# Sales-Insights-Data-Analysis
Sales data analysis for a chain hardware shop using AIMS grid, MYSQL and Power BI. 
The database consists of all the sales transactions, products, customers and the markets information. 
Generate some insights using SQL, analysed the database, then plugged the MYSQL database with Power BI. In power BI, I have performed ETL and data cleaning operations (performed currency normalization, handling invalid values, Outliers etc) so that I can build the Power BI report (dashboard).
